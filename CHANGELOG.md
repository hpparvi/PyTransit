# Changelog
## [2.6.9] - 2025-07-22

### Changed

- Improved `TSModel` accuracy by using a first-order Taylor series expansion of the planet-star intersection area. The
  error in transit depth estimates should now be ~1 ppm for Jupiter-sized planets and below this for smaller planets.
- Fixed issues with Scipy 2.0.

## [2.6.0] - 2024-02-01

### Added

- *TSModel:* An extremely fast transit model for transmission spectroscopy. The model is based on the RoadRunnerModel and can use any 
  rotationally symmetric function to model stellar limb darkening.
- *LDTkLDM:* A RoadRunnerModel limb darkening model that uses directly stellar intensity profiles created by the LDTk. The model is
  parameterised by the effective stellar temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. This should be quite valuable for transmission
  spectroscopy since the number of limb darkening parameters is independent of the number of passbands.

## [2.4.0] - 2020-10-14

### Added

- *EclipseModel:* an easy-to-use secondary eclipse model.

## [2.3.0] - 2020-09-16

### Added

 - *OblateStarModel:* transit model to model transits over rapidly rotating gravity-darkened stars by Barnes (2009).
   This is an initial release of the model (only a CPU version works at the moment) but I expect to 
   have it on-par with the rest of the models by v2.4.
 
### Changed

 - Renamed the *Swift* transit model introduced in v2.1 to *RoadRunner* transit model.
 - Fixed several *RoadRunner* model issues caused by the transition to calculating the
   projected distances using Taylor series expansion.
 - Changed several of the OpenCL models use the Taylor series expansion approach to calculate
   the projected distances.
 - Lots of minor bug fixes.

## [2.2.0] - 2020-09-13

PyTransit version 2.2 now calculates the normalized planet-star distances using a Taylor series expansion
of the x, and y positions in the sky plane (Parviainen and Korth, 2020, submitted to MNRAS). This gives a 
significant speed boost in transit model evaluation that is especially noticeable for eccentric orbits. 

## [2.1.0] - 2020-07-07

PyTransit version 2.1 adds a new transit model named *swift* that can use any Python callable to model the stellar
limb darkening while still giving equal or better performance than the analytical quadratic transit
model.

### Added

- *Swift* transit model (Parviainen, submitted) to allow fast and flexible transit modelling with
  any radially symmetric limb darkening model.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-07-07

PyTransit Version 2 removes the Fortran dependencies in v1 by implementing all the transit models
in *numba*-accelerated Python. Version 2 also adds a number of new transit models, and implements
most models both in CPU and GPU versions.

### Added
- New API that is consistent across all transit models.

### Changed
- Nearly everything.

## [1.0.0 beta] - 2014-09-02

PyTransit 1.0 implements the quadratic model by Mandel & Agol and the general model by 
Giménez with special optimisation that significantly improve the model evaluation speed.

## Early history - 2010

The first version of PyTransit saw light in 2010. It implemented the transit model for general
limb darkening law by Giménez and was used in 20-30 papers before the public release of v1.0.
